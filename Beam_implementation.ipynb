        "###### A Beam pipeline is a graph (specifically, a directed acyclic graph) where data is processed from input to output. This includes reading input data, transforming that data, and writing output data. A pipeline is constructed by a user in their SDK of choice. Then, the pipeline makes its way to the runner either through the SDK directly or through the Runner APIâ€™s RPC interface. \n",
